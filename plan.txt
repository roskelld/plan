+ Spent the week going through a somewhat painful update from Unreal 5.4.4 to 5.5.4. My blame on it being Unreal has simmered as I found that I hit more issues that were either already in the build or things I've added in belief that it would fix the issues I was seeing from the upgrade.
+ Found a map change crash when objects are on fire. Traced it back to a build called `new new new fire`, I think the issue might be related to the recent fire update. Just a hunch.
+ Fixed crash. Crash was easy to fix, what wasn't was the new crash that crept in due to the cooker not including a gameplayeffect. 
+ Working on a html export of the .plan system so posts are public.
+ Created scripts to generate webpage version of .plan and rss feed.
+ Back on build stability bugs hoping to get 5.5.4 ready to merge with main.
+ Hopefully the last major issue from the 5.5.4 upgrade is fixing the account log on issues.
+ 5.5.4 is now main. Also, added meta tags to the plan so link embeds show the latest post.
+ Cleaned up console warning messages. Feels good. 
+ Working on updating the skelve generation system so layouts have more governance over what is spawned.
+ First public playtest of 5.5.4 build and it went much smoother than last week. One crash relating to saving actors on map change related to missing attribute data. Success overall.
+ Been back on the skelve generation system. Now uses a multipass format: Layout->Content->Block unused entrances. Allows for more passes to be added in future.
+ One big change to the updated skelve generator is layout validity. When attempting to generate a new chamber (level chunk) it tests the space using a box overlap to see if it will fit or reject. 
+ Wrote a SnapToCeiling command for UnrealEd. Why spend a few minutes moving actors, when you can spent a few hours writing and debugging a command. I can see it paying off in the future.
