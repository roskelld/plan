This means that they get teleported back to the point where they initiated being downed instead of where they landed. Teleporting them to their final location has introduced a rotation deync issue that has proven a pain to resolve. I'm looking at alternate solutions in an attempt to stop fighting this one.</description></item><item><title>2025-09-24 21:48 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-8cbc214</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-8cbc214</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:48:43 +0000</pubDate><description>Added more player based collision events setup, including knock back from thrown objects.</description></item><item><title>2025-09-24 21:48 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-8cbc214</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-8cbc214</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:48:43 +0000</pubDate><description>Updated player damage to incorporate resistances.

This version of rope will allow players to deploy it down vertical drops where it will then mimic the behaviour of a ladder for others to climb. It will also support collecting to deploy elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>2025-05-27 21:08 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-9fbc00a</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-9fbc00a</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 21:08:03 +0000</pubDate><description>Rewriting what was the POI spawning system, which I'm now calling the Chamber Props system.
