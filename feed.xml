It'll be a few weeks of effort to integrate them, but will allow to exploit the new equip system much more than the current sausage-like characters. Plus they'll look nicer on the eye.</description></item><item><title>2025-11-29 17:14 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-5728c57</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-5728c57</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:14:44 +0000</pubDate><description>Tested the game with the new equip system in place. Some good discoveries of things still to update and bugs. Major update is to handle equipment based gameplay abilities, such as torch actions. Ability needs to know where torch mesh was spawned and it's shape so it can detect collisions.</description></item><item><title>2025-11-29 17:14 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-5728c57</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-5728c57</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:14:44 +0000</pubDate><description>Investagated</description></item><item><title>2025-11-27 20:43 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-5034273</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-5034273</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 20:43:50 +0000</pubDate><description>World items and character worn items now use same solution for attaching extra components, allowing VFX, lights other logic to be attached to sockets.

This means that they get teleported back to the point where they initiated being downed instead of where they landed.

This version of rope will allow players to deploy it down vertical drops where it will then mimic the behaviour of a ladder for others to climb. It will also support collecting to deploy elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>2025-05-27 21:08 UTC</title><link>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-9fbc00a</link><guid>https://roskelld.github.io/plan/#entry-9fbc00a</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 21:08:03 +0000</pubDate><description>Rewriting what was the POI spawning system, which I'm now calling the Chamber Props system.

Levels failed to load on clients, I believe due to me using FlushLevelStreaming which stopped code from running until the level load was complete, but this pause caused client sync issues.
