<div id='entry-481c4e8' class='entry'>Getting into the deep stuff now. Basic setup for rope locomotion is there, but the networking side is weak with client desync issues occurring during collision events. Time to do a deep dive into the Unreal Character Movement Component and the networking code.<div class='tags'>Commit 481c4e8</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-06-06'>June 06, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-f99995d' class='entry'>Got a bunch of rope fixes done to get characters attached to the rope and facing the right direction. Just setting the actor position/rotation for now and later we can figure out animating them. Next big task is allowing characters to rotate around the rope.<div class='tags'>Commit f99995d</div></div>
<div id='entry-207dc15' class='entry'>Tested a very early version of the rope, barely a v1, but it worked as far as showing off the potential of what it's like to explore underground caverns where you can dangle a rope off deep ledges and rappel down into the dark below. Work now continues to polish up the gameplay for that actual v1.<div class='tags'>Commit 207dc15</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-06-02'>June 02, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-2dfb771' class='entry'>After a long wait, it's finally time to start working on a v1 rope system. v1 is how we describe the most minimal implementation of an idea to get something tested quick and early. This version of rope will allow players to deploy it down vertical drops where it will then mimic the behaviour of a ladder for others to climb. It will also support collecting to deploy elsewhere.<div class='tags'>Commit 2dfb771</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-27'>May 27, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-9fbc00a' class='entry'>Rewriting what was the POI spawning system, which I'm now calling the Chamber Props system. It spawns crafted scenes of actors at predefined locations in a skelve with the intention of looking appropriate to the surroundings. The goal is to craft a language using gameplaytags where these can be built independent of location and picked to spawn based on the applied tags.<div class='tags'>Commit 9fbc00a</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-26'>May 26, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-91d05ca' class='entry'>Added a chamber graph so we eventually spawn chambers with an understanding of their surroundings, helping build out logical spaces using rules instead of generating skelves using pure random items from a lightly filtered list.<div class='tags'>Commit 91d05ca</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-24'>May 24, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-9bdb857' class='entry'>Test failed successfully. Levels failed to load on clients, I believe due to me using FlushLevelStreaming which stopped code from running until the level load was complete, but this pause caused client sync issues. The test gave us enough to think over things and present a new solution using OnLevelShown delegates to handle future updates, no need to pause code.<div class='tags'>Commit 9bdb857</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-23'>May 23, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-0c53492' class='entry'>Testing an early version of the new Skelve generator. The phase based generation is in now: Layout, content, exit capping. I see some refactoring already that will help give more data that's needed. Next phase is tackling the biome shifting using height as a driver.<div class='tags'>Commit 0c53492</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-20'>May 20, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-d4bab45' class='entry'>Wrote a SnapToCeiling command for UnrealEd. Why spend a few minutes moving actors, when you can spent a few hours writing and debugging a command. I can see it paying off in the future.<div class='tags'>Commit d4bab45</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-18'>May 18, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-65446bb' class='entry'>One big change to the updated skelve generator is layout validity. When attempting to generate a new chamber (level chunk) it tests the space using a box overlap to see if it will fit or reject.<div class='tags'>Commit 65446bb</div></div>
<div id='entry-f0de2ca' class='entry'>Been back on the skelve generation system. Now uses a multipass format: Layout-&gt;Content-&gt;Block unused entrances. Allows for more passes to be added in future.<div class='tags'>Commit f0de2ca</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-16'>May 16, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-7196013' class='entry'>First public playtest of 5.5.4 build and it went much smoother than last week. One crash relating to saving actors on map change related to missing attribute data. Success overall.<div class='tags'>Commit 7196013</div></div>

<div id='entry-6f6633e' class='entry'>Working on updating the skelve generation system so layouts have more governance over what is spawned.<div class='tags'>Commit 6f6633e</div></div>
<div id='entry-fea7a6b' class='entry'>Cleaned up console warning messages. Feels good.<div class='tags'>Commit fea7a6b</div></div>
<div id='entry-429c326' class='entry'>5.5.4 is now main. Also, added meta tags to the plan so link embeds show the latest post.<div class='tags'>Commit 429c326</div></div>

<div id='entry-c2ebf18' class='entry'>Fixed crash. Crash was easy to fix, what wasn't was the new crash that crept in due to the cooker not including a gameplayeffect.<div class='tags'>Commit c2ebf18</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-10'>May 10, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-7d23a3b' class='entry'>Found a map change crash when objects are on fire. Traced it back to a build called <code class='inline-code'>new new new fire</code>, I think the issue might be related to the recent fire update. Just a hunch.<div class='tags'>Commit 7d23a3b</div></div>
<div id='entry-68e7d8b' class='entry'>Spent the week going through a somewhat painful update from Unreal 5.4.4 to 5.5.4. My blame on it being Unreal has simmered as I found that I hit more issues that were either already in the build or things I've added in belief that it would fix the issues I was seeing from the upgrade.<div class='tags'>Commit 68e7d8b</div></div>
