<div id='entry-91d05ca' class='entry'>Added a chamber graph so we eventually spawn chambers with an understanding of their surroundings, helping build out logical spaces using rules instead of generating skelves using pure random items from a lightly filtered list.<div class='tags'>Commit 91d05ca</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-24'>May 24, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-9bdb857' class='entry'>Test failed successfully. Levels failed to load on clients, I believe due to me using FlushLevelStreaming which stopped code from running until the level load was complete, but this pause caused client sync issues. The test gave us enough to think over things and present a new solution using OnLevelShown delegates to handle future updates, no need to pause code.<div class='tags'>Commit 9bdb857</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-23'>May 23, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-0c53492' class='entry'>Testing an early version of the new Skelve generator. The phase based generation is in now: Layout, content, exit capping. I see some refactoring already that will help give more data that's needed. Next phase is tackling the biome shifting using height as a driver.<div class='tags'>Commit 0c53492</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-20'>May 20, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-d4bab45' class='entry'>Wrote a SnapToCeiling command for UnrealEd. Why spend a few minutes moving actors, when you can spent a few hours writing and debugging a command. I can see it paying off in the future.<div class='tags'>Commit d4bab45</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-18'>May 18, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-65446bb' class='entry'>One big change to the updated skelve generator is layout validity. When attempting to generate a new chamber (level chunk) it tests the space using a box overlap to see if it will fit or reject.<div class='tags'>Commit 65446bb</div></div>
<div id='entry-f0de2ca' class='entry'>Been back on the skelve generation system. Now uses a multipass format: Layout-&gt;Content-&gt;Block unused entrances. Allows for more passes to be added in future.<div class='tags'>Commit f0de2ca</div></div>

<div id='entry-7196013' class='entry'>First public playtest of 5.5.4 build and it went much smoother than last week. One crash relating to saving actors on map change related to missing attribute data. Success overall.<div class='tags'>Commit 7196013</div></div>

<div id='entry-7d23a3b' class='entry'>Found a map change crash when objects are on fire. Traced it back to a build called <code class='inline-code'>new new new fire</code>, I think the issue might be related to the recent fire update. Just a hunch.<div class='tags'>Commit 7d23a3b</div></div>
<div id='entry-68e7d8b' class='entry'>Spent the week going through a somewhat painful update from Unreal 5.4.4 to 5.5.4. My blame on it being Unreal has simmered as I found that I hit more issues that were either already in the build or things I've added in belief that it would fix the issues I was seeing from the upgrade.<div class='tags'>Commit 68e7d8b</div></div>
