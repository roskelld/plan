<div id='entry-31b563a' class='entry'>Oddly enough I just did the Unreal &lt;&gt; Blender transfer of a character skeletal mesh and it worked fine. So it seems that my attempt to use a "simple" one boned skeleton caused all the issues. I'll hopefully get to replacing the existing three character types later this week.<div class='tags'><div>Commit 31b563a</div><div>2:13pm</div></div></div>
<div id='entry-df60c67' class='entry'>Upon further investigation this is character mesh stuff is more complex due to the character's being modular. Scaling meshes and reimporting to the original skeleton causes undesired mesh offset. There's a few potential paths through this, each with their own costs. I think I'll have to go for creating a new skeleton and then investigate the re-targeting feature of Unreal.<div class='tags'><div>Commit df60c67</div><div>2:17pm</div></div></div>

<div id='entry-24b4052' class='entry'>Working on some pose animations for the new character. Ran into an issue where the control rig screws up the skeleton.

<div id='entry-363d697' class='entry'>I was trying to get Unreal and Blender to pass skeletal meshes between them using FBX but for the life of me I can't get the skeleton to stay in sync. They both interpret the data differently and screw up the skeleton binding. For now I can do simple things like import weapon meshes as static and get Unreal to convert them to skeletal, but I'll need to figure out a solution for handling the full character rig soon.<div class='tags'><div>Commit 363d697</div><div>10:29pm</div></div></div>

<div id='entry-0d455b4' class='entry'>Hit an issue handling downed players where they continue to move after being downed (such as falling to the ground) which comes after their movement system has been disabled (no player inputs). This means that they get teleported back to the point where they initiated being downed instead of where they landed. Teleporting them to their final location has introduced a rotation deync issue that has proven a pain to resolve. I'm looking at alternate solutions in an attempt to stop fighting this one.<div class='tags'><div>Commit 0d455b4</div><div>10:32am</div></div></div>
