<div id='entry-0d455b4' class='entry'>Hit an issue handling downed players where they continue to move after being downed (such as falling to the ground) which comes after their movement system has been disabled (no player inputs). This means that they get teleported back to the point where they initiated being downed instead of where they landed. Teleporting them to their final location has introduced a rotation deync issue that has proven a pain to resolve. I'm looking at alternate solutions in an attempt to stop fighting this one.<div class='tags'>Commit 0d455b4</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-09-24'>September 24, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-8cbc214' class='entry'>Updated player damage to incorporate resistances. Right now most damage is physical based. This opens up the door for using wearable items to increase resistances for better protection. Knock back events also take into consideration the physical resistance stat.<div class='tags'>Commit 8cbc214</div></div>
<div id='entry-8cbc214' class='entry'>Added more player based collision events setup, including knock back from thrown objects.<div class='tags'>Commit 8cbc214</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-09-21'>September 21, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-b77d647' class='entry'>Reworked player sprint collision. Handles environment collisions that can redirect players, up to knocking them back for hard impacts. Collisions against objects and players pushes them based on their mass and the sprinting player speed &amp; mass. The net result is Gnomes can be yeeted into the air by Giantkins.<div class='tags'>Commit b77d647</div></div>
<div id='entry-b77d647' class='entry'>Added a general fix player state solution that we can use to work around bugs to revert the player into a default state. We had many issues where players would get objects stuck in their hands or the UI stuck leaving them unable to play. The state fix works around this until we fix the bugs.<div class='tags'>Commit b77d647</div></div>

<div id='entry-1565797' class='entry'>After last week's playtest we saw that object physics suffered a fair amount of desync, with a large delay when waiting for net correction. I spent the weekend (and today) rewriting a lot of the code to use  Network Physics with resim, so corrections can come in during a sim. Also rewrote how objects handle having their physics enabled and disabled during play.<div class='tags'>Commit 1565797</div></div>

<div id='entry-461c851' class='entry'>Continuing with the barrier update. Most object interaction is handled now, barrier gets blocked by valid actor(s) in its path based on competing sturdiness values or actors get crushed.

<div id='entry-15e9a82' class='entry'>Though the rope climbing worked, when improving the climb onto rope root motion animation I found I had to do a good amount of rework to improve synchronization. Not perfect, but better now.<div class='tags'>Commit 15e9a82</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-06-20'>June 20, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-e838f50' class='entry'>Playtest for mantle and rope climb went well for a first pass. Focus can now be put onto bug fixing and improvements to the ux. Players feels more dynamic now they can climb ledges, this might require more adjustments to the environment to ensure we don't start to see too much independence again and lose the group support dynamic.<div class='tags'>Commit e838f50</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-06-18'>June 18, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-88bd8e9' class='entry'>Currently working on getting the camera to follow certain root motion animations when it makes sense. Working example is climbing on to rope from above, which requires the character to perform a 180 rotation onto the rope.<div class='tags'>Commit 88bd8e9</div></div>
<div id='entry-1d919b0' class='entry'>Got a basic handle on setting up root motion animations with a working example of mantling up ledges and other heights. This should aid with player navigation and reduce the reliance on jump serving as a vertical climbing method as jump is meant to be more for crossing distances.<div class='tags'>Commit 1d919b0</div></div>

<div id='entry-c601f82' class='entry'>Spent a day trying to debug an issue with a root motion animation not negating the animation offset. This took me on a journey of recreating the skeleton, rigging, skinning and fixing animations only to find that it was just an editor visualization setting and the animation was fine all along. Reverted a bunch of work, but gained new knowledge.<div class='tags'>Commit c601f82</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-06-13'>June 13, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-e74b943' class='entry'>After a long deep dive into the workings of the CMC we now have a rope climbing movement mode as well as a simple mantle off step.

<div id='entry-481c4e8' class='entry'>Getting into the deep stuff now. Basic setup for rope locomotion is there, but the networking side is weak with client desync issues occurring during collision events.

<div id='entry-f99995d' class='entry'>Got a bunch of rope fixes done to get characters attached to the rope and facing the right direction.

Next big task is allowing characters to rotate around the rope.<div class='tags'>Commit f99995d</div></div>
<div id='entry-207dc15' class='entry'>Tested a very early version of the rope, barely a v1, but it worked as far as showing off the potential of what it's like to explore underground caverns where you can dangle a rope off deep ledges and rappel down into the dark below. Work now continues to polish up the gameplay for that actual v1.<div class='tags'>Commit 207dc15</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-06-02'>June 02, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-2dfb771' class='entry'>After a long wait, it's finally time to start working on a v1 rope system. v1 is how we describe the most minimal implementation of an idea to get something tested quick and early. This version of rope will allow players to deploy it down vertical drops where it will then mimic the behaviour of a ladder for others to climb. It will also support collecting to deploy elsewhere.<div class='tags'>Commit 2dfb771</div></div>

<div id='entry-9fbc00a' class='entry'>Rewriting what was the POI spawning system, which I'm now calling the Chamber Props system. It spawns crafted scenes of actors at predefined locations in a skelve with the intention of looking appropriate to the surroundings. The goal is to craft a language using gameplaytags where these can be built independent of location and picked to spawn based on the applied tags.<div class='tags'>Commit 9fbc00a</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-26'>May 26, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-91d05ca' class='entry'>Added a chamber graph so we eventually spawn chambers with an understanding of their surroundings, helping build out logical spaces using rules instead of generating skelves using pure random items from a lightly filtered list.<div class='tags'>Commit 91d05ca</div></div>
<h4 id='2025-05-24'>May 24, 2025</h4>
<div id='entry-9bdb857' class='entry'>Test failed successfully. Levels failed to load on clients, I believe due to me using FlushLevelStreaming which stopped code from running until the level load was complete, but this pause caused client sync issues. The test gave us enough to think over things and present a new solution using OnLevelShown delegates to handle future updates, no need to pause code.<div class='tags'>Commit 9bdb857</div></div>
